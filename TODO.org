* TODO Problems to be solved
 - Code not yet testable in clean, isolated way.
   - Stock layout.erb causes generator to run bundler at construction
     time, other state-changing things.
   - Testing requires shelling out to generate template, running afoul
     of user prompting.

* TODO Document
** Opting out of a prompt via YAML "unless_recipe" means that question
   will not run if the indicated recipe is present -- even if that
   recipe itself is opted out of. This means if we want no frontend
   prompt to appear if the heroku recipe is an option, but do want the
   actual frontend recipe to run promptless, the heroku recipe will
   have to set the prefs object accordingly. Which means the frontend
   recipe must be marked to run after the heroku recipe so that it can
   respond to the settings defined in the heroku recipe.
